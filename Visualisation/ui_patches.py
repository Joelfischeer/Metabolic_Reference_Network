"""
Post-processing of the generated dashboard HTML (applied by build_viz() after the
HTML and the cohort buttons have been written).

1. apply_ui_patches():  the interface refinements that had been made directly in the
   generated HTML (compact top bar, slide-in sidebar, reference-network mode with
   signed partial-correlation colouring, "r = ..." badge on connections, ...).
   They are stored as (new_block, old_block) text replacements in ui_patches.json, so a
   rebuild of the dashboard no longer loses them.
2. inject_weighted_cohort_matrices():  replaces the 0/1 cohort matrices behind the
   "Healthy cohort" / "Obese cohort" buttons by the partial-correlation matrices
   (|r| of significant edges keeps its sign, everything else 0), read from the
   <condition>_cohort_PC_connections.csv / _PC_significance.csv files. Positive edges
   are drawn blue, negative edges red.
