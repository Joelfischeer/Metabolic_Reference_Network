"""
reprocess_same_sentence_filter.py
==================================
Re-apply the same-sentence organ+organ+crosstalk filter to every cached
pair in reference_network_only_metabolic/metabolic_literature_results.json,
using the already-cached papers — no PubMed calls. Use this after adding or
changing _filter_same_sentence_crosstalk() in run_metabolic_lit_search.py to
bring an already-fully-cached results file up to date without a full
--reset re-search (which would needlessly re-hit PubMed for every pair).

The cached papers already satisfy the PubMed query's document-level
crosstalk requirement (both organs + a crosstalk keyword somewhere in the
document) — this script only narrows that down further to the stricter
same-sentence co-location, then re-derives key_players/connection_type from
the narrowed paper set.

Run from the Metabolic_Reference_Network/ directory:
    uv run python reprocess_same_sentence_filter.py
Then rebuild the dashboard:
    uv run python run_metabolic_lit_search.py --viz-only
